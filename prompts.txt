Please provide the ENTIRE code for the functions that changed so I can easily copy and paste.  Do not try to shorten the functions with comments like ‘the rest is unchanged, I always need the full function so I can copy and paste without losing prior data.  Also it’s very important you tell me what function to put it BEFORE or AFTER and the section it’s in so I place it organization wise in the right place if you propose new functions, you don’t have to do this for existing functions of course.  Note if you changed CSS or HTML, I will need the COMPLETE file for those so I can easily copy and paste as well.  Again for existing functions that already exist you don’t have to mention placement details, only for new ones.
