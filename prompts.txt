NOTE: Please provide the ENTIRE code for the functions/methods that changed so I can easily copy and paste.  Same for Classes, just the methods that changed.  Do not try to shorten the functions or methods with comments like â€˜the rest is unchanged, I always need the full function so I can copy and paste without losing prior data.  Also do not put the file path above the functions inside the part where I copy and paste.  If the functions you are modifying have comments above it make sure to add or edit to that in a way that makes sense, and if it does not have comments it should so that you can explain to yourself in the future what it is.  The only exception will be for 1 or 2 line edits only! If the changes are greater then this just provide the ENTIRE function/method.  Do not give me a COPY of the ENTIRE source code, again only functions that changed.  The exception would be if you changed CSS or HTML, I will need the COMPLETE file for those so I can easily copy and paste in those cases only.
