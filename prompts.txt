Please provide the ENTIRE code for the functions that changed so I can easily copy and paste.  Do not try to shorten the functions with comments like ‘the rest is unchanged, I always need the full function so I can copy and paste without losing prior data.  Also it’s very important you tell me what function to put it BEFORE or AFTER and the section it’s in so I place it organization wise in the right place if you propose new functions, you don’t have to do this for existing functions of course.  Note if you changed CSS or HTML, I will need the COMPLETE file for those so I can easily copy and paste as well.  Again for existing functions that already exist you don’t have to mention placement details, only for new ones.

NOTE: Please provide the ENTIRE code for the functions/methods that changed so I can easily copy and paste.  Same for Classes, just the methods that changed.  Do not try to shorten the functions or methods with comments like ‘the rest is unchanged, I always need the full function so I can copy and paste without losing prior data.  Also do not put the file path above the functions inside the part where I copy and paste.  If the functions you are modifying have comments above it make sure to add or edit to that in a way that makes sense, and if it does not have comments it should so that you can explain to yourself in the future what it is.  Do not give me a COPY of the ENTIRE source code, again only functions that changed.  The exception would be if you changed CSS or HTML, I will need the COMPLETE file for those so I can easily copy and paste in those cases only.
